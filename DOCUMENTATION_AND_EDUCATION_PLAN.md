# TapFlow Analytics Platform - Documentation & Education Master Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines a comprehensive approach to creating self-generating documentation and educational materials that automatically stay synchronized with the TapFlow Analytics platform. All content will be generated from the actual codebase, database schema, and real data to ensure accuracy and relevance.

## 1. Self-Generating Documentation Architecture

### 1.1 Data Catalog Generator
```yaml
Purpose: Automatically document all tables, columns, and relationships
Source: PostgreSQL information_schema and dbt models
Output: 
  - docs/data_catalog/
    - raw_layer.md
    - staging_layer.md
    - intermediate_layer.md
    - metrics_layer.md
    - entity_relationship_diagrams.md
```

**Implementation:**
- Python script: `scripts/generate_data_catalog.py`
- Runs on database schema changes
- Includes:
  - Table descriptions from dbt schema.yml
  - Column data types and constraints
  - Row counts and data freshness
  - Sample queries for each table
  - Visual ERD using mermaid diagrams

### 1.2 Metrics & KPI Documentation
```yaml
Purpose: Document all business metrics with lineage
Source: dbt metrics definitions and SQL transformations
Output:
  - docs/metrics_catalog/
    - revenue_metrics.md
    - operational_metrics.md
    - customer_metrics.md
    - product_metrics.md
```

**Features:**
- Metric definitions with SQL logic
- Data lineage (source → transformation → output)
- Business context and use cases
- Calculation examples with real data
- Refresh frequency and SLAs

### 1.3 API Documentation
```yaml
Purpose: Document data access patterns and best practices
Source: Common query patterns from actual usage
Output:
