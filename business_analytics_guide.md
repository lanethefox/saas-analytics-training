## Entity-Centric Modeling

### Three-Table Pattern

Each entity implements our proven three-table architecture:

#### 1. Atomic Tables (`entity_*`)
Current state with real-time metrics - optimized for operational dashboards.

```sql
-- Example: entity_customers
SELECT 
    company_name,
    monthly_recurring_revenue,
    customer_health_score,
    churn_risk_score,
    total_devices,
    total_users
FROM entity.entity_customers
WHERE customer_tier = 3  -- Enterprise customers
  AND churn_risk_score > 60;
```

#### 2. History Tables (`entity_*_history`)
Complete change tracking for temporal analysis and audit trails.

```sql
-- Example: Track customer tier changes over time
SELECT 
    company_name,
    customer_tier,
    effective_from,
    effective_to,
    change_reason
FROM entity.entity_customers_history
WHERE customer_id = 'specific-customer-uuid'
ORDER BY effective_from DESC;
```

#### 3. Grain Tables (`entity_*_daily/hourly/weekly`)
Time-series aggregations for trend analysis and reporting.

```sql
-- Example: Monthly customer health trends
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', metric_date) as month,
    AVG(customer_health_score) as avg_health_score,
    AVG(churn_risk_score) as avg_churn_risk,
    COUNT(*) as customer_count
FROM entity.entity_customers_daily
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', metric_date)
ORDER BY month DESC
LIMIT 12;
```

### Design Principles

#### 1. Denormalization for Performance
Pre-calculated metrics stored directly in entity tables:

```sql
-- Customer table includes pre-calculated aggregations
total_locations,        -- Count from locations table
total_devices,          -- Count from devices table  
total_users,           -- Count from users table
device_events_30d,     -- Aggregated from device events
avg_device_uptime_30d  -- Calculated device performance
```

#### 2. Business-Friendly Naming
Table and column names match business terminology:

```sql
-- Instead of technical names like "cust_hlth_scr"
customer_health_score       -- Clear business meaning
churn_risk_score           -- Understood by all stakeholders
monthly_recurring_revenue  -- Standard SaaS metric
```

#### 3. Comprehensive Metrics
Each entity includes operational, financial, and predictive metrics:

```sql
-- Operational metrics
device_health_score, uptime_percentage_30d, events_30d

-- Financial metrics  
monthly_recurring_revenue, lifetime_value, revenue_per_location

-- Predictive metrics
churn_risk_score, customer_health_score, payment_health_score
```

## Business Intelligence Capabilities

### Query Performance

Entity-Centric Modeling delivers exceptional query performance:

- **Single-table queries**: No complex joins required
- **Pre-aggregated metrics**: Calculations done during ETL
- **Strategic indexing**: Optimized for common query patterns
- **Result caching**: Redis layer for dashboard speed

### Sample Query Performance

```sql
-- Complex business question answered in single query (< 1 second)
SELECT 
    company_name,
    customer_tier,
    monthly_recurring_revenue,
    customer_health_score,
    churn_risk_score,
    total_devices,
    avg_device_uptime_30d,
    CASE 
        WHEN churn_risk_score > 80 THEN 'Critical Risk'
        WHEN churn_risk_score > 60 THEN 'High Risk'  
        WHEN churn_risk_score > 40 THEN 'Medium Risk'
        ELSE 'Low Risk'
    END as risk_category
FROM entity.entity_customers
WHERE customer_tier = 3  -- Enterprise
  AND customer_status = 'active'
ORDER BY churn_risk_score DESC;
```

### Self-Service Analytics

Business users can answer complex questions without SQL expertise:

#### Example: "Which enterprise customers are at risk?"
```sql
SELECT company_name, churn_risk_score, monthly_recurring_revenue
FROM entity.entity_customers  
WHERE customer_tier = 3 AND churn_risk_score > 60
ORDER BY monthly_recurring_revenue DESC;
```

#### Example: "What's our device uptime by location?"
```sql
SELECT location_name, city, state_code, 
       ROUND(AVG(uptime_percentage_30d), 1) as avg_uptime
FROM entity.entity_devices d
JOIN entity.entity_locations l ON d.location_id = l.location_id
GROUP BY location_name, city, state_code
HAVING AVG(uptime_percentage_30d) < 95
ORDER BY avg_uptime;
```

### Recommended Dashboard Patterns

#### 1. Executive Dashboard
**Key Principles:**
- 5-second rule: Critical insights visible immediately
- Single screen: No scrolling required for key KPIs
- Traffic light system: Red/Yellow/Green status indicators

```sql
-- Executive KPI Query Example
SELECT 
    'Total MRR' as metric,
    '$' || TO_CHAR(SUM(monthly_recurring_revenue), 'FM999,999,999.00') as value,
    CASE 
        WHEN SUM(monthly_recurring_revenue) >= 50000 THEN 'Green'
        WHEN SUM(monthly_recurring_revenue) >= 25000 THEN 'Yellow'
        ELSE 'Red'
    END as status_indicator
FROM entity.entity_customers
WHERE customer_status = 'active';
```

#### 2. Marketing Performance Dashboard
Track campaign effectiveness and attribution:

```sql
-- Campaign ROI Analysis
SELECT 
    campaign_name,
    total_spend,
    leads_generated,
    customers_acquired,
    total_revenue_attributed,
    ROUND(total_revenue_attributed / NULLIF(total_spend, 0), 2) as roi_ratio
FROM entity.entity_campaigns
WHERE campaign_status = 'completed'
ORDER BY roi_ratio DESC;
```

#### 3. Operations Monitoring Dashboard
Real-time operational health across all locations:

```sql
-- Location Health Summary
SELECT 
    location_name,
    city,
    state_code,
    operational_health_score,
    online_devices,
    total_devices,
    ROUND(online_devices::numeric / NULLIF(total_devices, 0) * 100, 1) as connectivity_rate
FROM entity.entity_locations
WHERE location_status = 'active'
ORDER BY operational_health_score ASC;
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Dashboard Load Time Targets
- **Executive dashboards**: < 3 seconds
- **Operational dashboards**: < 5 seconds  
- **Detailed analysis**: < 10 seconds

#### Optimization Techniques
1. **Use grain tables** for time-series visualizations
2. **Leverage pre-calculated metrics** in atomic tables
3. **Enable Redis caching** for frequently accessed data
4. **Implement incremental refresh** for real-time requirements

## Data Governance

### Data Quality Standards

#### Master Data Management
- **Customer entities** serve as golden records across all systems
- **Unique identifiers (UUIDs)** ensure consistency across domains
- **Data lineage tracking** maintains transparency in transformations
- **Regular data quality audits** prevent degradation over time

#### Quality Metrics Framework
- **Completeness**: 95%+ required fields populated
- **Accuracy**: Data validation rules enforced
- **Consistency**: Cross-domain reconciliation checks
- **Timeliness**: Maximum 15-minute data freshness SLA

```sql
-- Data Quality Check Example
SELECT 
    'Customer Health Score Validation' as check_name,
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN customer_health_score BETWEEN 0 AND 100 THEN 1 END) as valid_scores,
    ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN customer_health_score BETWEEN 0 AND 100 THEN 1 END)::numeric / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) as pass_rate
FROM entity.entity_customers;
```

### Access Control Framework

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Executive Dashboard**: C-level and VPs only
- **Departmental Analytics**: Department heads and analysts  
- **Operational Data**: Relevant team members and managers
- **Sensitive PII**: Strict need-to-know basis with encryption

#### Data Classification Levels
1. **Public**: Aggregated metrics, anonymized insights
2. **Internal**: Departmental KPIs, operational metrics
3. **Confidential**: Customer PII, financial details
4. **Restricted**: Strategic planning data, competitive intelligence

## Performance Optimization

### Query Performance Guidelines

#### 1. Leverage Pre-Calculated Metrics
```sql
-- ✅ FAST: Use pre-calculated metrics
SELECT customer_health_score, churn_risk_score
FROM entity.entity_customers;

-- ❌ SLOW: Calculate on-the-fly
SELECT AVG(engagement_score), COUNT(support_tickets)
FROM users u JOIN support_tickets st ON u.user_id = st.user_id;
```

#### 2. Use Appropriate Grain Tables
```sql
-- ✅ FAST: Use daily grain for trends
SELECT metric_date, AVG(daily_active_users)
FROM entity.entity_customers_daily
WHERE metric_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY metric_date;

-- ❌ SLOW: Aggregate atomic data
SELECT DATE(session_timestamp), COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)
FROM user_sessions
WHERE session_timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(session_timestamp);
```

#### 3. Strategic Filtering
```sql
-- ✅ FAST: Filter early and specifically
SELECT company_name, monthly_recurring_revenue
FROM entity.entity_customers
WHERE customer_tier = 3 
  AND customer_status = 'active'
  AND churn_risk_score > 60;

-- ❌ SLOW: Complex WHERE clauses on large datasets
SELECT * FROM entity.entity_customers
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at) = 2024
  AND monthly_recurring_revenue > (SELECT AVG(monthly_recurring_revenue) FROM entity.entity_customers);
```

### Indexing Strategy

#### Primary Indexes (Automated)
- All primary keys (UUIDs) automatically indexed
- Foreign key relationships indexed for join performance
- Timestamp fields indexed for date range queries

#### Strategic Secondary Indexes
```sql
-- Customer analysis index
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_tier_status_risk 
ON entity.entity_customers (customer_tier, customer_status, churn_risk_score);

-- Device monitoring index
CREATE INDEX idx_devices_location_status_health
ON entity.entity_devices (location_id, device_status, device_health_score);

-- Time-series analysis index
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_daily_date_account
ON entity.entity_customers_daily (metric_date, account_id);
```

### Caching Strategy

#### Redis Configuration
- **Dashboard queries**: 15-minute cache for executive dashboards
- **Real-time metrics**: 1-minute cache for operational dashboards
- **Historical data**: 1-hour cache for trend analysis
- **Reference data**: 24-hour cache for lookup tables

---

## Best Practices

### SQL Best Practices

#### 1. Readable Query Structure
```sql
-- Use clear formatting and meaningful aliases
SELECT 
    c.company_name,
    c.monthly_recurring_revenue as mrr,
    c.customer_health_score as health_score,
    CASE 
        WHEN c.churn_risk_score > 80 THEN 'Critical Risk'
        WHEN c.churn_risk_score > 60 THEN 'High Risk'
        ELSE 'Low Risk'
    END as risk_category
FROM entity.entity_customers c
WHERE c.customer_status = 'active'
ORDER BY c.churn_risk_score DESC;
```

#### 2. Performance-Optimized Patterns
```sql
-- Use EXISTS instead of IN for better performance
SELECT company_name
FROM entity.entity_customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM entity.entity_devices d 
    WHERE d.account_id = c.account_id 
      AND d.device_status = 'offline'
);

-- Use CASE WHEN for conditional aggregations
SELECT 
    customer_tier,
    COUNT(*) as total_customers,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN churn_risk_score > 60 THEN 1 END) as high_risk_customers,
    ROUND(AVG(monthly_recurring_revenue), 2) as avg_mrr
FROM entity.entity_customers
GROUP BY customer_tier;
```

### Dashboard Design Principles

#### 1. Executive Dashboard Guidelines
- **5-second rule**: Critical insights visible immediately
- **Progressive disclosure**: Summary → Detail drill-down
- **Consistent color coding**: Red/Yellow/Green status system
- **Mobile-responsive**: Viewable on all device sizes

#### 2. Operational Dashboard Guidelines
- **Real-time updates**: Critical metrics refresh automatically
- **Alert integration**: Visual and email notifications
- **Action-oriented**: Clear next steps for issues
- **Context-aware**: Relevant filters and comparisons

#### 3. Self-Service Analytics
- **Business-friendly naming**: Avoid technical jargon
- **Guided exploration**: Suggested questions and paths
- **Template galleries**: Common analysis patterns
- **Documentation links**: Help and context available

### Data Quality Monitoring

#### Automated Quality Checks
```sql
-- Daily data quality report
WITH quality_checks AS (
    SELECT 
        'Customer Health Scores' as metric,
        COUNT(*) as total_records,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN customer_health_score BETWEEN 0 AND 100 THEN 1 END) as valid_records,
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP as check_timestamp
    FROM entity.entity_customers
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT 
        'Device Connectivity',
        COUNT(*),
        COUNT(CASE WHEN last_heartbeat_at > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1 hour' THEN 1 END),
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    FROM entity.entity_devices
    WHERE device_status = 'active'
)
SELECT 
    metric,
    total_records,
    valid_records,
    ROUND(valid_records::numeric / total_records * 100, 2) as quality_score,
    CASE 
        WHEN valid_records::numeric / total_records < 0.95 THEN '❌ FAIL'
        WHEN valid_records::numeric / total_records < 0.98 THEN '⚠️ WARN'
        ELSE '✅ PASS'
    END as status
FROM quality_checks;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: Dashboard Loading Slowly
**Symptoms**: Dashboards take > 10 seconds to load
**Root Causes**:
- Complex queries without proper indexing
- Large dataset without appropriate filtering
- Cache misses or disabled caching

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check query performance
docker exec -it saas_platform_postgres psql -U superset_readonly -d saas_platform_dev

# Enable query logging
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT ... FROM entity.entity_customers;

# Clear Redis cache
docker exec -it saas_platform_redis redis-cli FLUSHDB

# Restart Superset
docker restart saas_platform_superset
```

#### Issue 2: Data Quality Alerts
**Symptoms**: Missing data or inconsistent metrics
**Root Causes**:
- ETL pipeline failures
- Source system connectivity issues
- Data validation rule violations

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check dbt run status
cd dbt_project && dbt run --select entity

# Validate data quality
dbt test --select entity

# Check Airflow DAG status
docker exec -it saas_platform_airflow airflow dags list

# Manual data refresh
dbt run --full-refresh --select entity_customers
```

#### Issue 3: Database Connection Issues
**Symptoms**: "Connection refused" errors in Superset
**Root Causes**:
- PostgreSQL service down
- Network connectivity issues
- Authentication problems

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL status
docker ps | grep postgres

# Test database connection
docker exec -it saas_platform_postgres psql -U superset_readonly -d saas_platform_dev -c "SELECT 1;"

# Restart database service
docker restart saas_platform_postgres

# Check service logs
docker logs saas_platform_postgres
```

### Health Check Commands

#### System Health Verification
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# complete_health_check.sh

echo "=== Data Platform Health Check ==="

# Check all services
echo "1. Service Status:"
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}" | grep saas_platform

# Test database connectivity
echo -e "\n2. Database Connectivity:"
docker exec -it saas_platform_postgres psql -U superset_readonly -d saas_platform_dev -c "SELECT 'Database Connected' as status;"

# Check Superset accessibility
echo -e "\n3. Superset Accessibility:"
curl -s http://localhost:8088/health | grep -q "OK" && echo "✅ Superset healthy" || echo "❌ Superset issues"

# Validate entity tables
echo -e "\n4. Entity Tables Status:"
docker exec -it saas_platform_postgres psql -U superset_readonly -d saas_platform_dev -c "
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    n_tup_ins as row_count
FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'entity' 
ORDER BY tablename;"

# Check data freshness
echo -e "\n5. Data Freshness:"
docker exec -it saas_platform_postgres psql -U superset_readonly -d saas_platform_dev -c "
SELECT 
    'entity_customers' as table_name,
    MAX(created_at) as latest_record,
    EXTRACT(HOURS FROM (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - MAX(created_at))) as hours_since_update
FROM entity.entity_customers;"

echo -e "\n=== Health Check Complete ==="
```

### Performance Monitoring

#### Query Performance Analysis
```sql
-- Identify slow queries
SELECT 
    query,
    mean_time,
    calls,
    total_time,
    rows,
    100.0 * shared_blks_hit / nullif(shared_blks_hit + shared_blks_read, 0) AS hit_percent
FROM pg_stat_statements 
ORDER BY mean_time DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Table size analysis
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as size,
    pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) as size_bytes
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'entity'
ORDER BY size_bytes DESC;
```
