## Platform Quick Start

### Access Information
```bash
# Platform Components
- PostgreSQL Database: localhost:5432
- Apache Superset: http://localhost:8088
- Jupyter Lab: http://localhost:8888
- Documentation: http://localhost:8080/docs

# Database Connection
- Host: localhost
- Port: 5432
- Database: saas_platform_dev
- Username: superset_readonly
- Password: superset_readonly_password_2024
```

### Entity Tables Overview
The platform uses Entity-Centric Modeling with 7 core entities:

| Entity | Table Name | Records | Key Metrics |
|--------|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Customers** | `entity_customers` | 100 | MRR, health score, churn risk |
| **Devices** | `entity_devices` | 1,205 | Uptime, events, maintenance |
| **Locations** | `entity_locations` | 241 | Revenue, device health |
| **Users** | `entity_users` | 337 | Activity, adoption, features |
| **Subscriptions** | `entity_subscriptions` | 441 | MRR movements, lifecycle |
| **Campaigns** | `entity_campaigns` | 310 | CAC, ROI, conversions |
| **Features** | `entity_features` | 10 | Adoption, usage, impact |

### Three-Table Pattern
Each entity implements:
1. **Atomic Table** (`entity_customers`) - Current state, real-time metrics
2. **History Table** (`entity_customers_history`) - Complete change history
3. **Grain Table** (`entity_customers_daily`) - Pre-aggregated time-series

    customer_id
  FROM entity_customers
),
periods AS (
  SELECT 
    generate_series(0, 11) as period_number
)
SELECT 
  cohort_month,
  period_number,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as customers
FROM cohorts c
CROSS JOIN periods p
-- Add retention logic
```

**2. Period-over-Period Comparison**
```sql
WITH current_period AS (
  SELECT 
    metric_name,
    metric_value,
    'current' as period_type
  FROM metrics_table 
  WHERE date_column >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
),

    metric_name,
    metric_value,
    'prior' as period_type
  FROM metrics_table 
  WHERE date_column >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '60 days'
    AND date_column < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
)
SELECT 
  c.metric_name,
  c.metric_value as current_value,
  p.metric_value as prior_value,
  (c.metric_value - p.metric_value) / p.metric_value * 100 as growth_rate
FROM current_period c
JOIN prior_period p ON c.metric_name = p.metric_name
```

**3. Funnel Analysis**
```sql
WITH funnel_steps AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN step = 'signup' THEN 1 END) as signups,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN step = 'trial' THEN 1 END) as trials,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN step = 'paid' THEN 1 END) as conversions
  FROM customer_journey
  GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT 
  SUM(signups) as total_signups,
  SUM(trials) as total_trials,
  SUM(conversions) as total_conversions,
  SUM(trials)::float / SUM(signups) * 100 as signup_to_trial,
  SUM(conversions)::float / SUM(trials) * 100 as trial_to_paid
FROM funnel_steps
```
