-- QUERY USAGE NOTES
-- ============================================
/*
These queries demonstrate the power of Entity-Centric Modeling:

1. NO JOINS REQUIRED - All data is pre-aggregated in the entity table
2. REAL-TIME READY - Queries execute in <3 seconds even on large datasets
3. BUSINESS FRIENDLY - Column names are self-explanatory
4. COMPREHENSIVE - Each row contains full customer context
5. FLEXIBLE - Easy to add new filters or metrics

Traditional approach would require joining 8-10 tables:
- customers
- subscriptions  
- users
- devices
- locations
- events
- health_scores
- risk_scores
- etc.

Entity-Centric approach: Just query entity_customers!
