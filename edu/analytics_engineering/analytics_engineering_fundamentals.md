# Analytics Engineering Fundamentals

## Module Overview

Analytics Engineering bridges the gap between data engineering and data analysis, focusing on the transformation layer that turns raw data into trusted, business-ready datasets. This module teaches you how to maintain and evolve entity-centric models in a production environment.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this module, you will be able to:

1. **Design and Maintain Entity Models**
   - Develop new entity models following ECM principles
   - Modify existing entities based on business requirements
   - Deprecate legacy models safely
   - Handle schema evolution

2. **Implement Incremental Processing**
   - Convert batch models to incremental
   - Handle late-arriving data
   - Manage incremental failures and recovery
   - Optimize for performance

3. **Develop Grain Tables**
   - Create time-series aggregations
   - Build custom grains for specific reports
   - Balance query performance vs. storage
   - Handle grain backfills

4. **Curate the Mart Layer**
   - Design domain-specific marts
   - Implement access patterns
   - Create reusable components
   - Document business logic

5. **Govern the Metrics Layer**
   - Define canonical metrics
   - Version metric definitions
   - Ensure metric consistency
   - Monitor metric quality
