-- Module 1: SaaS Fundamentals - Practice Exercises
-- Work through these exercises to master Entity-Centric Modeling

-- ============================================
-- EXERCISE 1: Customer Health Dashboard
-- ============================================
-- Build a comprehensive dashboard for Customer Success teams
-- Requirements:
-- 1. Show all active customers
-- 2. Include health score, churn risk, and MRR
-- 3. Calculate user adoption rate
-- 4. Identify customers needing intervention
-- 5. Sort by priority (highest risk first)

-- YOUR QUERY HERE:
-- Hint: Start with SELECT from entity_customers
-- Add calculated fields for adoption rates
-- Use CASE statements for risk categorization




-- ============================================
-- EXERCISE 2: MRR Growth Analysis
-- ============================================
-- Analyze MRR growth patterns
-- Requirements:
-- 1. Calculate MRR by customer tier
-- 2. Show new vs expansion vs churned MRR
-- 3. Include customer counts
-- 4. Calculate average MRR per tier

-- YOUR QUERY HERE:
-- Hint: Use GROUP BY customer_tier
-- Consider using FILTER or CASE for MRR categories




-- ============================================
-- EXERCISE 3: Engagement Segmentation
-- ============================================
-- Segment customers by engagement level
-- Requirements:
-- 1. Define engagement tiers based on active users %
-- 2. Calculate average health score per tier
-- 3. Show revenue distribution
-- 4. Identify upsell opportunities

-- YOUR QUERY HERE:
-- Hint: Use CASE to create engagement tiers
-- Join with benchmarks using CTEs




-- ============================================
-- EXERCISE 4: Churn Risk Identification
-- ============================================
-- Identify customers at risk of churning
-- Requirements:
-- 1. Find customers with declining usage
-- 2. Include those with low engagement
-- 3. Calculate potential revenue loss
-- 4. Suggest intervention strategies

-- YOUR QUERY HERE:
-- Hint: Look for zero usage, low adoption
-- Use multiple conditions in WHERE




-- ============================================
-- EXERCISE 5: Expansion Opportunity Finder
-- ============================================
-- Find customers ready for tier upgrades
-- Requirements:
-- 1. Compare usage to tier benchmarks
-- 2. Only include healthy customers
-- 3. Calculate potential revenue increase
-- 4. Rank by opportunity size

-- YOUR QUERY HERE:
-- Hint: Use percentiles to find benchmarks
-- Filter for health_score > 70
