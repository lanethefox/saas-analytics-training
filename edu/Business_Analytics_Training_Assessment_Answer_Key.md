### Short Answer Questions (5 questions, 6 points each)

**21. Explain the business value of Entity-Centric Modeling compared to traditional approaches. (3-4 sentences)**

*Sample Answer: Entity-Centric Modeling enables business users to answer complex questions with simple, single-table queries instead of complex multi-table joins. This democratizes analytics by making data accessible to non-technical stakeholders while ensuring consistent metric definitions. Performance is dramatically improved since all relevant metrics are pre-calculated and stored together, enabling sub-second response times for dashboard queries.*

*Estimated completion time: 3 minutes*

**22. Describe how you would identify customers at risk of churning using entity tables. (3-4 sentences)**

*Sample Answer: I would query the entity_customers table for accounts with high churn_risk_score (>70), zero device_events_30d indicating no usage, low user adoption rates (<30%), or extended periods since last_user_activity. These signals combined with health_score decline and support ticket volume would indicate customers needing immediate intervention.*

*Estimated completion time: 3 minutes*

**23. Walk through calculating Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for a SaaS business. (4-5 sentences)**

*Sample Answer: CLV equals average monthly revenue per customer multiplied by gross margin percentage, divided by monthly churn rate. For example, if average MRR is $500, gross margin is 80%, and monthly churn is 2%, then CLV = ($500 × 0.80) / 0.02 = $20,000. This represents the total profit expected from a customer relationship and should be compared to CAC to ensure profitable unit economics.*

*Estimated completion time: 4 minutes*

**24. Explain how the three-table pattern (atomic, history, grain) serves different analytical needs. (4-5 sentences)**

*Sample Answer: The atomic table provides current state for operational dashboards and real-time monitoring with metrics updated every 15 minutes. The history table captures every state change for temporal analysis, trend detection, and understanding what drove metric changes over time. The grain table offers pre-aggregated daily snapshots optimized for executive reporting and period-over-period comparisons, enabling fast time-series analysis without complex calculations.*

*Estimated completion time: 4 minutes*

**25. How would you explain MRR movement analysis to a non-technical executive? (3-4 sentences)**

*Sample Answer: MRR movement tracks how our monthly recurring revenue changes from new customers, existing customer upgrades (expansion), downgrades (contraction), and cancellations (churn). Think of it like a bucket where water flows in from new customers and upgrades, while flowing out from downgrades and cancellations. The net change tells us if we're growing or shrinking our revenue base, and the breakdown shows which levers to focus on for growth.*

### Short Answer Questions (7 questions, 5 points each)

**26. Explain how to conduct a cohort retention analysis and what insights it provides. (4-5 sentences)**

*Sample Answer: Cohort retention analysis groups customers by acquisition period (e.g., signup month) and tracks their retention over time. Create a table showing what percentage of each cohort remains active after 1, 3, 6, 12 months. This reveals if retention is improving with newer cohorts, when churn stabilizes (indicating product-market fit), and helps predict long-term customer value. The analysis also identifies seasonal patterns and the impact of product changes on customer retention.*

*Estimated completion time: 4 minutes*

**27. Describe the difference between leading and lagging indicators in product analytics. (3-4 sentences)**

*Sample Answer: Leading indicators predict future outcomes and include metrics like user onboarding completion rates, feature adoption in first 30 days, and early usage patterns. Lagging indicators measure past results such as retention rates, revenue per user, and churn. Leading indicators enable proactive intervention (e.g., improving onboarding to boost retention), while lagging indicators confirm whether strategies worked.*

*Estimated completion time: 3 minutes*

**28. How would you measure and optimize the ROI of different marketing channels? (4-5 sentences)**

*Sample Answer: Calculate channel ROI by dividing revenue generated by channel spend, using proper attribution models to allocate credit across touchpoints. Track metrics like CAC by channel, conversion rates, and customer LTV by acquisition source. Optimize by reallocating budget to channels with highest ROI and LTV:CAC ratios, while testing new channels at small scale. Consider both short-term conversion and long-term customer value when evaluating channel performance.*

*Estimated completion time: 4 minutes*

**29. Explain how usage-based pricing models affect revenue analytics compared to subscription models. (4-5 sentences)**

*Sample Answer: Usage-based pricing creates variable monthly revenue tied to customer activity, making forecasting more complex but enabling natural expansion. Revenue analytics must track consumption patterns, usage trends, and capacity planning rather than just subscription counts. This model typically results in higher NRR as growing customers automatically generate more revenue. However, it also creates revenue volatility and requires sophisticated tracking of usage metrics and pricing thresholds.*

*Estimated completion time: 4 minutes*

**30. Describe how to build a feature adoption funnel and what it reveals about product usage. (4-5 sentences)**

*Sample Answer: A feature adoption funnel tracks progression from feature discovery to regular usage: awareness → trial → initial adoption → sustained usage → mastery. Measure what percentage of users progress through each stage and identify the biggest drop-off points. This reveals whether features are discoverable, easy to adopt, and valuable enough for continued use. High drop-off at trial suggests UX issues, while drop-off at sustained usage indicates low value realization.*

*Estimated completion time: 4 minutes*

**31. How do you analyze pricing sensitivity and its impact on customer segments? (4-5 sentences)**

*Sample Answer: Analyze price elasticity by examining how conversion rates and customer behavior change across different price points or after pricing changes. Segment customers by characteristics (size, industry, usage) and measure willingness to pay through A/B testing or historical analysis. Track metrics like price realization rates, discount patterns, and churn by pricing tier. This reveals which segments are price-sensitive versus value-focused, informing pricing strategy and packaging decisions.*

*Estimated completion time: 4 minutes*

**32. Explain how to measure and improve customer onboarding success using analytics. (4-5 sentences)**

*Sample Answer: Define onboarding success metrics like time-to-first-value, completion of key setup steps, and usage milestones achieved in first 30 days. Track progression through onboarding flows and identify where users drop off or get stuck. Measure correlation between onboarding completion and long-term retention/expansion. Use this data to optimize flows, prioritize feature improvements, and create targeted interventions for at-risk new users.*

Build optimistic, realistic, and pessimistic scenarios with probability weightings. Model impact of strategic decisions like pricing changes, new market entry, or product launches. Include sensitivity analysis to identify which variables most impact outcomes. Use Monte Carlo simulation for sophisticated probability distributions. This planning supports strategic decisions on fundraising, hiring, and investment priorities by quantifying risk and upside potential.*

**36. How would you analyze competitive positioning using customer and market data? (5-6 sentences)**

*Sample Answer: Analyze competitive positioning through win/loss data, customer satisfaction comparisons, feature gap analysis, and pricing benchmarking. Track win rates against specific competitors over time and identify patterns by deal size, industry, or use case. Conduct customer surveys comparing your solution to alternatives they evaluated. Monitor competitor customer reviews and social sentiment for positioning insights. Combine quantitative analysis (win rates, deal metrics) with qualitative insights (customer feedback) to identify competitive strengths and vulnerabilities that inform product and go-to-market strategy.*
