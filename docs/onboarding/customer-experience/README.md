## ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices

### 1. **Health Score Interpretation**
- **80-100**: Healthy customers, focus on expansion
- **60-79**: Neutral, maintain engagement
- **40-59**: At risk, intervention needed
- **0-39**: Critical, immediate action required

### 2. **Churn Prevention Workflow**
1. Daily monitoring of churn risk scores
2. Weekly review of high-risk accounts
3. Proactive outreach when scores drop
4. Track intervention effectiveness

### 3. **Support Optimization**
- Monitor ticket volume trends by segment
- Track resolution times against SLAs
- Identify common issues for knowledge base
- Measure support impact on health scores

### 4. **Engagement Monitoring**
Key ratios to track:
- WAU/MAU (Weekly stickiness)
- DAU/MAU (Daily stickiness)
- Power user percentage
- Feature adoption rates
