## üìä Data Governance Guidelines

### 1. Data Quality Standards

**Master Data Management:**
- **Customer entities** serve as golden records across all systems
- **Unique identifiers (UUIDs)** ensure consistency across domains
- **Data lineage tracking** maintains transparency in transformations
- **Regular data quality audits** prevent degradation over time

**Data Validation Rules:**
```sql
-- Example: Customer Health Score Validation
CONSTRAINT valid_health_score 
  CHECK (customer_health_score BETWEEN 0 AND 100)

-- Example: Revenue Data Integrity
CONSTRAINT positive_revenue 
  CHECK (monthly_recurring_revenue >= 0)
```

**Quality Metrics Framework:**
- **Completeness**: 95%+ required fields populated
- **Accuracy**: Data validation rules enforced
- **Consistency**: Cross-domain reconciliation checks
- **Timeliness**: Maximum 15-minute data freshness SLA

### 2. Access Control and Security

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
- **Executive Dashboard**: C-level and VPs only
- **Departmental Analytics**: Department heads and analysts
- **Operational Data**: Relevant team members and managers
- **Sensitive PII**: Strict need-to-know basis with encryption

**Data Classification Levels:**
1. **Public**: Aggregated metrics, anonymized insights
2. **Internal**: Departmental KPIs, operational metrics
3. **Confidential**: Customer PII, financial details
4. **Restricted**: Strategic planning data, competitive intelligence

**Audit and Compliance:**
- **Access logging**: All data access tracked and auditable
- **Retention policies**: Automatic data lifecycle management
- **Privacy controls**: GDPR/CCPA compliance mechanisms
- **Change tracking**: Full audit trail for sensitive data modifications

### 3. Data Stewardship Framework

**Domain Data Owners:**
- **Customer Success**: Account health, churn risk, engagement metrics
- **Product**: Feature usage, adoption rates, product analytics
- **Marketing**: Campaign performance, attribution, lead scoring
- **Sales**: Pipeline metrics, conversion rates, quota attainment
- **Finance**: Revenue metrics, billing health, financial KPIs
- **Operations**: Device health, location performance, service quality

**Cross-Domain Governance:**
- **Data Council**: Monthly cross-functional data governance meetings
- **Metric Definitions**: Centralized business glossary and calculations
- **Change Management**: Formal process for schema and metric changes
- **Conflict Resolution**: Escalation procedures for data disputes

## üèóÔ∏è Dimensional Modeling Best Practices

### 1. Entity-Centric Design Principles

**Three-Table Pattern Implementation:**
```sql
-- Atomic Tables: Current state snapshot
entity_customers           -- Real-time customer state
entity_devices            -- Current device status
entity_subscriptions      -- Active subscription details

-- History Tables: Complete change tracking
entity_customers_history   -- All customer state changes
entity_devices_history     -- Device lifecycle events
entity_subscriptions_history -- Subscription modifications

-- Grain Tables: Time-series aggregations
entity_customers_daily     -- Daily customer metrics
entity_devices_hourly      -- Hourly device performance
entity_subscriptions_monthly -- Monthly revenue cohorts
```

**Denormalization Strategy:**
- **Performance-critical metrics** pre-calculated and stored
- **Frequently accessed dimensions** embedded in fact tables
- **Cross-domain metrics** materialized for sub-second queries
- **Hierarchical rollups** pre-aggregated for dashboard performance

### 2. Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Patterns

**Type 1 - Overwrite (Operational Data):**
- Device status updates
- User profile information
- Location operational details

**Type 2 - Historical Tracking (Business Critical):**
```sql
-- Example: Customer tier changes tracking
CREATE TABLE entity_customers_history (
    customer_id UUID,
    tier_level TEXT,
    effective_from TIMESTAMP,
    effective_to TIMESTAMP,
    is_current BOOLEAN,
    change_reason TEXT
);
```

**Type 3 - Previous Value (Limited History):**
- Account status transitions
- Plan upgrades/downgrades
- Territory assignments

### 3. Fact Table Design Patterns

**Additive Facts:**
- Revenue amounts (MRR, ARR)
- Usage volumes (tap events, page views)
- Count metrics (devices, users, sessions)

**Semi-Additive Facts:**
- Balance snapshots (account values)
- Inventory levels (device counts)
- Score snapshots (health scores)

**Non-Additive Facts:**
- Ratios and percentages
- Calculated scores
- Index values

**Factless Fact Tables:**
- Event occurrences (maintenance events)
- Relationship tracking (user-feature associations)
- Coverage analysis (device-location assignments)

## üìà Dashboard Design Guidelines

### 1. Executive Dashboard Principles

**Golden Rules:**
- **5-second rule**: Key insights visible within 5 seconds
- **Single screen**: Critical KPIs fit on one screen without scrolling
- **Traffic light system**: Red/Yellow/Green status indicators
- **Drill-down capability**: Summary to detail navigation paths

**Executive KPI Hierarchy:**
```
Level 1: Strategic (Monthly/Quarterly)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MRR/ARR Growth Rate
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Customer Health Score
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Net Revenue Retention
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Gross Revenue Retention

Level 2: Operational (Weekly)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ New Customer Acquisition
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Customer Churn Rate
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Product Adoption Metrics
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Service Quality Scores

Level 3: Tactical (Daily)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Pipeline Velocity
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Support Ticket Resolution
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Device Uptime Percentage
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Campaign Performance
```

### 2. Domain-Specific Dashboard Patterns
