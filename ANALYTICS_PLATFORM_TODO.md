## üîÑ Session Resumption Instructions

To continue from where we left off:

1. **Reference this session as**: "ANALYTICS_PLATFORM_BUILDOUT"
2. **Current focus**: Building analytics platform documentation and goals
3. **Next priority**: Create Superset dashboards for each team
4. **Key context**: 
   - Platform serves 20k+ accounts, 30k+ locations
   - 4 analytics teams (Sales, CX, Marketing, Product)
   - Entity-centric model with 7 core entities
   - 150+ pre-calculated metrics available

## üìù Notes for Next Session

### Questions to Address
1. Should we version control the Superset dashboards?
2. Do we need separate dev/staging/prod environments?
3. What's the approval process for new metrics?
4. How should we handle metric deprecation?

### Technical Debt to Consider
