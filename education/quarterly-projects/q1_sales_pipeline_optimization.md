# Q1 Project: Sales Pipeline Optimization

## Project Charter

### Executive Summary
The sales team is struggling with pipeline predictability and efficiency. Deal velocity has slowed, and forecast accuracy is below 70%. This project will create an automated pipeline health scoring system to identify risks early and improve forecast accuracy to 85%+.

### Business Context
- Current win rate: 22%
- Average deal cycle: 67 days (target: 45 days)
- Forecast accuracy: 68% (target: 85%)
- Pipeline coverage ratio: 2.8x (target: 3.5x)

### Stakeholders
- **Primary**: VP of Sales (Sarah Chen)
- **Secondary**: Sales Operations Manager, Regional Sales Directors
- **Executive Sponsor**: CRO (David Park)

### Success Criteria
1. Improve forecast accuracy from 68% to 85%
2. Reduce average deal cycle by 20%
3. Identify 80% of at-risk deals 30 days before close date
4. Achieve 90% adoption of new health scoring system

        CASE 
            WHEN customer_status = 'customer' THEN 'won'
            WHEN churned_at IS NOT NULL THEN 'lost'
            ELSE 'open'
        END as outcome,
        datediff('day', score_calculated_date, 
                 COALESCE(became_customer_at, churned_at)) as days_to_outcome
    FROM calculated.pipeline_health_scores
    WHERE score_calculated_date >= CURRENT_DATE - 90
)
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN pipeline_health_score >= 80 THEN 'healthy'
        WHEN pipeline_health_score >= 60 THEN 'moderate'
        ELSE 'at_risk'
    END as health_category,
    outcome,
    COUNT(*) as deal_count,
    AVG(days_to_outcome) as avg_days_to_close

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple**: Build a basic version first, then iterate
2. **Get Feedback Early**: Show mockups before building
3. **Focus on Adoption**: The best model is useless if not used
4. **Automate Everything**: Manual processes won't scale
5. **Document Decisions**: Future you will thank present you
