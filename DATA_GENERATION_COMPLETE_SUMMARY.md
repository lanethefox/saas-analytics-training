## üöÄ Ready for Superset

### Why This Data is Perfect for Dashboards:

1. **Entity-Centric Structure**
   - Clean relationships between accounts ‚Üí locations ‚Üí devices
   - Pre-calculated metrics in subscription metadata
   - Rich dimensional data for slicing/dicing

2. **Time-Series Data**
   - Historical data spanning proper timeframes
   - Daily/hourly patterns in usage data
   - Seasonal variations in marketing data

3. **Business Metrics Ready**
   - MRR, churn, customer acquisition cost
   - Device uptime, beer volume, pour counts
   - Marketing ROI, conversion rates
   - Support ticket resolution times

4. **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**

   - By geography (state, timezone)
   - By subscription tier (Basic, Pro, Enterprise)
   - By device type and status
   - By user role and activity

### Suggested Superset Dashboards:

1. **Executive Dashboard**
   - MRR trends and growth
   - Customer acquisition and churn
   - Geographic distribution map
   - Device fleet health

2. **Operations Dashboard**

## üé¨ Next Steps

1. **Verify Superset Connection**
   - Superset is running on port 8088
   - Login: admin/admin_password_2024
   - Database connection to PostgreSQL already configured

2. **Start with Simple Charts**
   - Account growth over time
   - Revenue by subscription tier
   - Device status distribution
   - Geographic heat maps

3. **Build Complex Dashboards**

## üí° Tips for Superset Development

1. **Use the Raw Schema**: All data is in the `raw` schema
2. **Leverage JSON Fields**: Many tables have rich JSON/JSONB columns
3. **Time Zones**: Location data includes timezone for proper time analysis
4. **Hierarchies**: Account ‚Üí Location ‚Üí Device relationships are clean
5. **Pre-Calculated Metrics**: Subscription metadata has many ready-to-use KPIs
