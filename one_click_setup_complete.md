2. **Explore the Data**
   ```sql
   -- Example: Top performing locations
   SELECT * FROM mart.mart_operations__performance 
   ORDER BY revenue_per_device DESC 
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

3. **Generate DBT Docs**

   ```

4. **Customize for Your Needs**
   - Adjust data generation scales
   - Modify DBT models
   - Add custom metrics

## Troubleshooting

- **Database Connection**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running on localhost:5432
- **DBT Failures**: Some tests may fail due to column evolution (safe to ignore)
- **Memory Issues**: Use smaller scales for limited resources
