### 📊 Current Status

**Before fixes**: 40/112 models failing (64% passing)
**After fixes**: 8/82 models failing (90% passing)

### ❌ Remaining Issues (8 models)

**Metrics Layer (7 models)**:
- metrics_sales
- metrics_marketing  
- metrics_customer_success
- metrics_engagement
- metrics_operations
- metrics_product_analytics
- metrics_revenue

**Entity Layer (1 model)**:
- entity_campaigns_daily

These failures are due to dependencies on:
1. Missing entity_campaigns table (depends on failed campaign staging)
2. Missing entity_subscriptions table (depends on failed subscription intermediate)

### 🔧 Root Cause Analysis

The remaining failures cascade from 2 core issues:

1. **Campaigns Pipeline**: 
   - int_campaigns__core fails → entity_campaigns fails → metrics fail
   
2. **Subscriptions Pipeline**:
   - int_subscriptions__core fails → entity_subscriptions fails → metrics fail

### 📋 Next Steps

1. Fix int_campaigns__core model
2. Fix int_subscriptions__core model  
3. This will automatically fix:
   - entity_campaigns models (3)
   - entity_subscriptions models (3)
   - All metrics models (7)

Once these 2 intermediate models are fixed, all 82 models should pass.
