- Revenue forecasting

## ðŸ“Š Key Tables & Metrics

### Primary Sales Tables

1. **`metrics.sales`** - Your main analytics table
   - Pre-calculated sales KPIs updated daily
   - Includes pipeline, performance, and activity metrics
   - Optimized for dashboard queries

2. **`entity.entity_customers`** - Customer master data
   - Current state of all customers
   - Revenue metrics (MRR, ARR, LTV)
   - Customer segmentation fields

3. **`entity.entity_campaigns`** - Marketing attribution
   - Lead source tracking
   - Campaign performance
   - Multi-touch attribution

### Essential Metrics

| Metric | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `total_pipeline_value` | Sum of all open opportunities | Pipeline coverage |
| `qualified_pipeline_value` | Stage 3+ opportunities | Forecast accuracy |
| `pipeline_coverage_ratio` | Pipeline / Quota | Risk assessment |
| `avg_deal_size` | Average opportunity value | Pricing strategy |
| `avg_sales_cycle_days` | Time from opp to close | Process efficiency |
| `win_rate` | Closed Won / Total Closed | Team effectiveness |
| `deals_won_mtd` | Closed deals this month | Monthly performance |
| `revenue_closed_mtd` | Revenue closed this month | Quota tracking |

WHERE deals_won > 0
ORDER BY revenue_closed DESC;
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices

### 1. **Use Pre-Calculated Metrics**
Always start with `metrics.sales` table for standard KPIs. Only join to raw tables when you need additional detail.

### 2. **Time Period Consistency**
- Use `date = CURRENT_DATE` for point-in-time metrics
- Use date ranges for trend analysis
- Be consistent with fiscal calendar if applicable

### 3. **Segmentation Strategy**
Common segments to analyze:
- Customer tier (SMB, Mid-Market, Enterprise)
- Industry vertical
- Geographic region
- Product line
- Lead source

### 4. **Performance Benchmarking**
Compare metrics against:
- Historical performance (YoY, QoQ, MoM)
- Team/peer averages
- Industry benchmarks
- Company targets
