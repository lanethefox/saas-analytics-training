## üìö Level 1: Basic SELECT Queries

### Exercise 1.1: Your First Query
```sql
-- TODO: Run this query to see all active customers
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    company_name,
    customer_tier,
    monthly_recurring_revenue
FROM entity.entity_customers
WHERE is_active = true
LIMIT 10;

-- ‚úÖ Expected: 10 rows of customer data
-- üí° Learning: Basic SELECT, WHERE, LIMIT
```

### Exercise 1.2: Filtering and Sorting
```sql
-- TODO: Find Enterprise customers with high MRR
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    company_name,
    monthly_recurring_revenue,
    customer_health_score
FROM entity.entity_customers
WHERE customer_tier = 'Enterprise'
  AND monthly_recurring_revenue > 5000
ORDER BY monthly_recurring_revenue DESC;

-- ‚úÖ Expected: Enterprise customers sorted by MRR
-- üí° Learning: Multiple WHERE conditions, ORDER BY
```

### Exercise 1.3: Working with Dates
```sql
-- TODO: Find customers who joined in the last 90 days
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    company_name,
    first_subscription_date,
    months_since_first_subscription
FROM entity.entity_customers
WHERE first_subscription_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
ORDER BY first_subscription_date DESC;

-- ‚úÖ Expected: Recent customers
-- üí° Learning: Date arithmetic, INTERVAL
```

### üèÜ Level 1 Challenge
```sql
-- TODO: Find at-risk SMB customers
-- Hint: Use customer_tier, churn_risk_score, and is_active
-- Your query here:




-- Solution (try first!):
-- SELECT customer_id, company_name, churn_risk_score
-- FROM entity.entity_customers
-- WHERE customer_tier = 'SMB'
--   AND churn_risk_score > 70
--   AND is_active = true
-- ORDER BY churn_risk_score DESC;
```

---

## üîó Level 2: JOINs and Relationships

### Exercise 2.1: Basic JOIN
```sql
-- TODO: Join customers with their users
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.company_name,
    u.user_id,
    u.email,
    u.engagement_score
FROM entity.entity_customers c
JOIN entity.entity_users u ON c.customer_id = u.customer_id
WHERE c.customer_tier = 'Enterprise'
  AND u.user_status = 'active'
LIMIT 20;

-- ‚úÖ Expected: Customer-user pairs
-- üí° Learning: INNER JOIN, table aliases
```

### Exercise 2.2: LEFT JOIN
```sql
-- TODO: Find customers with NO active users (potential churn risk)
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.company_name,
    c.customer_health_score,
    COUNT(u.user_id) as active_user_count
FROM entity.entity_customers c
LEFT JOIN entity.entity_users u 
    ON c.customer_id = u.customer_id
    AND u.user_status = 'active'
WHERE c.is_active = true
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.company_name, c.customer_health_score
HAVING COUNT(u.user_id) = 0
ORDER BY c.customer_health_score ASC;

-- ‚úÖ Expected: Customers without active users
-- üí° Learning: LEFT JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING
```

### Exercise 2.3: Multiple JOINs
```sql
-- TODO: Customer overview with devices and locations
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.company_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT l.location_id) as location_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT d.device_id) as device_count,
    AVG(d.overall_health_score) as avg_device_health
FROM entity.entity_customers c
LEFT JOIN entity.entity_locations l ON c.customer_id = l.customer_id
LEFT JOIN entity.entity_devices d ON l.location_id = d.location_id
WHERE c.is_active = true
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.company_name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT d.device_id) > 0
ORDER BY device_count DESC;

-- ‚úÖ Expected: Customer device summary
-- üí° Learning: Multiple JOINs, COUNT DISTINCT
```

### üèÜ Level 2 Challenge
```sql
-- TODO: Find customers with high-value but low engagement
-- Join customers, users, and subscriptions
-- Filter for MRR > 5000 but avg engagement < 50
-- Your query here:




-- Hint: You'll need entity_customers, entity_users, and calculate AVG(engagement_score)
```

    AVG(customer_health_score) as avg_health_score,
    AVG(churn_risk_score) as avg_churn_risk
FROM entity.entity_customers
WHERE is_active = true
GROUP BY customer_tier
ORDER BY total_mrr DESC;

-- ‚úÖ Expected: Summary by tier

    SUM(monthly_recurring_revenue) as cohort_mrr,
    AVG(lifetime_value) as avg_ltv,
    AVG(months_since_first_subscription) as avg_tenure
FROM entity.entity_customers
WHERE first_subscription_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', first_subscription_date)
ORDER BY cohort_month DESC
LIMIT 12;

-- ‚úÖ Expected: Last 12 monthly cohorts
-- üí° Learning: DATE_TRUNC, time-based grouping
```

### Exercise 3.3: Conditional Aggregations
```sql
-- TODO: Health score distribution

        WHEN customer_health_score >= 60 THEN 'Neutral (60-79)'
        WHEN customer_health_score >= 40 THEN 'At Risk (40-59)'
        ELSE 'Critical (0-39)'
    END as health_segment,
    COUNT(*) as customer_count,
    SUM(monthly_recurring_revenue) as segment_mrr,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) as pct_of_customers
FROM entity.entity_customers
WHERE is_active = true
GROUP BY health_segment
ORDER BY 
    CASE health_segment
        WHEN 'Healthy (80-100)' THEN 1
        WHEN 'Neutral (60-79)' THEN 2

    company_name,
    customer_tier,
    monthly_recurring_revenue,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY monthly_recurring_revenue DESC) as mrr_rank,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_tier ORDER BY monthly_recurring_revenue DESC) as tier_rank,
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY monthly_recurring_revenue DESC) as mrr_percentile
