## ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices

### 1. **Engagement Metrics Hierarchy**
- **Primary**: DAU, WAU, MAU, Stickiness
- **Secondary**: Session duration, frequency
- **Tertiary**: Feature adoption, depth of use
- **Leading indicators**: Time to value, activation rate

### 2. **Cohort Analysis Standards**
- Always use consistent time windows
- Compare like-for-like cohorts
- Account for seasonality
- Track both retention and resurrection

### 3. **Feature Success Criteria**
Define success metrics before launch:
- Target adoption rate
- Expected retention impact
- Usage frequency goals
- Revenue contribution

### 4. **User Segmentation Strategy**
Segment by:
- Engagement level (power/regular/casual)
- Lifecycle stage (new/active/at-risk)
- Use case/persona
- Customer tier

## ðŸ”— Integration Points
