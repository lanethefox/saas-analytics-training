# Module 4: Product Analytics

## Overview

Product analytics bridges the gap between what you build and how customers use it. It's about understanding user behavior, measuring feature success, and using data to guide product development. In SaaS, product analytics directly impacts retention, expansion, and customer satisfaction.

## The Product Analytics Framework

### Key Objectives

1. **Understand Usage**: How customers interact with your product
2. **Measure Engagement**: Depth and frequency of usage
3. **Identify Friction**: Where users struggle or abandon
4. **Guide Development**: What to build next based on data
5. **Prove Value**: Connect usage to business outcomes

### Types of Product Data

**Event Data**: User actions (clicks, views, submits)
```
User 123 → Clicked "Create Report" → 2024-01-15 10:23:45
```

**State Data**: Current configuration or status
```
Feature X → Enabled for Customer ABC → Since 2024-01-01
```

**Session Data**: Grouped user activity
```
Session 456 → 15 minutes → 23 events → 5 features used
```

## Core Product Metrics

### 1. User Engagement Metrics

**Daily Active Users (DAU)**:
```sql
-- Calculate DAU with engagement breakdown
WITH daily_activity AS (
  SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('day', event_timestamp) as activity_date,
    user_id,
    COUNT(*) as events,
    COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) as sessions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT feature_name) as features_used
  FROM product_events
  WHERE event_timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
  GROUP BY 1, 2
)SELECT 
  activity_date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as dau,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN events >= 10 THEN user_id END) as power_users,
  AVG(events) as avg_events_per_user,
  AVG(features_used) as avg_features_per_user
FROM daily_activity
GROUP BY activity_date
ORDER BY activity_date DESC;

**Weekly/Monthly Active Users (WAU/MAU)**:
```sql
-- Calculate stickiness (DAU/MAU ratio)
WITH user_activity AS (
  SELECT 
    user_id,
    DATE_TRUNC('day', event_timestamp) as activity_date
  FROM product_events
  WHERE event_timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
  GROUP BY 1, 2
),
dau_calc AS (
  SELECT 
    activity_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as dau
  FROM user_activity
  GROUP BY activity_date
),
mau_calc AS (
  SELECT 
    activity_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) OVER (
      ORDER BY activity_date 
      ROWS BETWEEN 29 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as mau
  FROM user_activity
)SELECT 
  d.activity_date,
  d.dau,
  m.mau,
  ROUND(100.0 * d.dau / NULLIF(m.mau, 0), 1) as stickiness_pct
FROM dau_calc d
JOIN mau_calc m ON d.activity_date = m.activity_date
ORDER BY d.activity_date DESC;

### 2. Feature Adoption Metrics

**Feature Adoption Funnel**:
```sql
-- Track feature adoption progression
WITH feature_funnel AS (
  SELECT 
    f.feature_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT u.user_id) as total_users,
    COUNT(DISTINCT e.user_id) as users_discovered,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN e.event_type = 'feature_activated' THEN e.user_id END) as users_activated,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN e.usage_count >= 3 THEN e.user_id END) as users_adopted,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN e.days_since_last_use <= 7 THEN e.user_id END) as users_retained
  FROM features f
  CROSS JOIN users u
  LEFT JOIN feature_events e ON f.feature_id = e.feature_id AND u.user_id = e.user_id
  GROUP BY f.feature_name
)
SELECT 
  feature_name,
  users_discovered,
  ROUND(100.0 * users_activated / NULLIF(users_discovered, 0), 1) as activation_rate,
  ROUND(100.0 * users_adopted / NULLIF(users_activated, 0), 1) as adoption_rate,
  ROUND(100.0 * users_retained / NULLIF(users_adopted, 0), 1) as retention_rate,
  ROUND(100.0 * users_retained / NULLIF(total_users, 0), 1) as overall_penetration
FROM feature_funnel
ORDER BY overall_penetration DESC;
```

    MIN(e.event_timestamp) as first_use,
    DATEDIFF('day', f.release_date, MIN(e.event_timestamp)) as days_to_adopt
  FROM features f
  JOIN feature_events e ON f.feature_id = e.feature_id
  JOIN users u ON e.user_id = u.user_id
  WHERE e.event_type = 'feature_used'
  GROUP BY f.feature_name, f.release_date, u.user_id
)
SELECT 
  feature_name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as adopters,
  AVG(days_to_adopt) as avg_days_to_adopt,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY days_to_adopt) as median_days_to_adopt,

## Key Product Analytics Best Practices

### 1. Event Tracking Excellence
- **Consistent Naming**: Use clear, standardized event names
- **Complete Context**: Include relevant properties with each event
- **User Privacy**: Respect data privacy regulations
- **Performance Impact**: Monitor tracking overhead

### 2. Analysis Framework
- **Start with Questions**: Define what you want to learn
- **Segment Thoughtfully**: Different user groups behave differently
- **Consider Time**: Account for seasonality and lifecycle stages
- **Validate Findings**: Cross-check insights with qualitative data

### 3. Stakeholder Communication
- **Focus on Outcomes**: Connect metrics to business goals
- **Tell Stories**: Use specific user examples
- **Visualize Effectively**: Choose appropriate chart types
- **Provide Context**: Compare to benchmarks and trends
## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Vanity Metrics**: Focus on actionable metrics, not just big numbers
2. **Selection Bias**: Ensure representative samples in analysis
3. **Correlation ≠ Causation**: Validate relationships with experiments
4. **Over-Tracking**: Too many events create noise
5. **Ignoring Qualitative**: Numbers don't tell the whole story

## Key Takeaways

1. **Engagement Drives Retention**: Active users stay longer
2. **Features Need Context**: Usage alone doesn't indicate value
3. **First Impressions Matter**: Early behavior predicts long-term success
4. **Segments Reveal Insights**: Averages hide important patterns
5. **Speed Matters**: Performance directly impacts usage
