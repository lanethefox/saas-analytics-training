# Analytics Engineer - Day in the Life

Welcome to your role as an Analytics Engineer at TapFlow Analytics! Today is Tuesday, and you're responsible for maintaining and evolving our entity-centric data model.

## üåÖ 8:00 AM - Morning Checks

Start your day by checking the health of your data pipelines:

```sql
-- Check dbt run history
SELECT 
    run_started_at,
    run_completed_at,
    status,
    models_completed,
    models_failed,
    execution_time
FROM dbt_analytics.run_history
WHERE run_started_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY run_started_at DESC;
```

**Your Task**:
1. Review last night's dbt runs
2. Check for any test failures
3. Investigate any model timing anomalies
4. Review PR comments from overnight

## üìß 8:30 AM - Stakeholder Request

The Revenue team needs historical monthly grain data for a board presentation:

**Request**: "We need monthly revenue by product line going back 2 years, including churn cohorts"

```sql
-- Current grain only goes back 1 year
SELECT MIN(date), MAX(date) 
FROM entity.entity_subscriptions_monthly;

-- New requirement needs backfill
```

**Your Task**:
1. Assess current grain coverage
2. Plan backfill strategy
3. Estimate completion time
4. Communicate approach to stakeholder

## üîß 9:30 AM - Incremental Model Conversion

The `int_user_engagement_metrics` model is taking too long to run. Time to convert it to incremental:

```sql
-- Current model performance
-- Runtime: 45 minutes
-- Records: 50M+
-- Full refresh daily

-- Your conversion task:
{{ config(
    materialized='incremental',
    unique_key='user_id',
    on_schema_change='fail',
    incremental_strategy='merge'
) }}

WITH user_activity AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id,
        DATE(activity_timestamp) as activity_date,
        COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) as sessions,
        SUM(actions_taken) as total_actions,
        MAX(activity_timestamp) as last_activity
    FROM {{ ref('stg_app__user_activities') }}
    
    {% if is_incremental() %}
    -- Only process new/updated records
    WHERE activity_timestamp > (
        SELECT MAX(last_activity) 
        FROM {{ this }}
    )
    {% endif %}
    
    GROUP BY 1, 2
)
-- Rest of model logic...
```

**Your Task**:
1. Identify the unique key
2. Determine incremental strategy
3. Handle late-arriving data
4. Add appropriate tests
5. Document the change

## ‚òï 10:30 AM - New Entity Model Design

Product team is launching a "Teams" feature. You need to design a new entity model:

```yaml
# Entity: Teams
# Description: Grouping of users within a customer account
# Relationships: 
#   - Parent: Customers (many-to-one)
#   - Children: Users (one-to-many)
#   - Related: Devices (through locations)

# Required tables:
# 1. entity_teams (atomic/current state)
# 2. entity_teams_history (SCD Type 2)
# 3. entity_teams_daily (time-series grain)

# Key metrics:
# - team_size
# - active_user_percentage  
# - feature_adoption_score
# - collaboration_index
# - team_health_score
```

**Your Task**:
1. Design the entity schema
2. Define relationships
3. Plan metric calculations
4. Create dbt model templates
5. Write data quality tests

## üçΩÔ∏è 12:00 PM - Lunch & Learn: Metric Governance

Present your approach to metric consistency:

```sql
-- Metric definition example
-- metrics/revenue_metrics.yml
version: 2

metrics:
  - name: monthly_recurring_revenue
    label: MRR
    model: ref('entity_customers')
    description: "Total recurring revenue from all active subscriptions"
    
    calculation_method: sum
    expression: monthly_recurring_revenue
    
    timestamp: snapshot_date
    time_grains: [day, week, month, quarter, year]
    
    dimensions:
      - customer_tier
      - customer_segment
      - sales_region
    
    filters:
      - field: customer_status
        operator: '='
        value: 'active'
        
    meta:
      owner: revenue_team
      verified: true
      sla_hours: 4
```

**Your Task**:
1. Demonstrate metric versioning
2. Show impact analysis for changes
3. Explain testing strategy
4. Discuss documentation standards

## üìä 2:00 PM - Model Deprecation

The old `customer_facts` table needs to be deprecated in favor of `entity_customers`:

```sql
-- Deprecation checklist:
-- 1. Identify all dependencies
WITH model_dependencies AS (
    SELECT 
        parent_model,
        child_model,
        ref_type
    FROM dbt_analytics.model_dependencies
    WHERE parent_model = 'customer_facts'
)

-- 2. Create migration guide
-- 3. Update downstream models
-- 4. Add deprecation warning
-- 5. Set sunset date
-- 6. Monitor usage
```

**Your Task**:
1. Map all dependencies
2. Create migration documentation
3. Update 3 downstream models
4. Implement usage tracking
5. Communicate timeline

## üîç 3:00 PM - Performance Optimization

The `entity_devices_hourly` grain is causing query timeouts:

```sql
-- Current issues:
-- 180k devices * 24 hours * 365 days = 1.5B rows
-- No partitioning
-- Missing indexes

-- Optimization approach:
{{ config(
    materialized='incremental',
    partition_by={
      "field": "grain_timestamp",
      "data_type": "timestamp",
      "granularity": "day"
    },
    cluster_by=["device_id", "location_id"],
    incremental_strategy='insert_overwrite'
) }}
```

**Your Task**:
1. Analyze query patterns
2. Implement partitioning strategy
3. Add clustering keys
4. Create materialized aggregates
5. Test performance improvements

## üìù 4:00 PM - Documentation Sprint

Update documentation for recent changes:

```markdown
## Entity Model: Subscriptions

### Recent Changes (v2.3.0)
- Added `expansion_revenue` calculation
- Implemented incremental processing (5x faster)
- New grain: `entity_subscriptions_hourly` for real-time dashboards
- Deprecated: `arr_by_customer` (use `entity_customers.annual_recurring_revenue`)

### Metric Definitions
| Metric | Definition | Business Logic |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| mrr | Monthly Recurring Revenue | SUM(quantity * unit_price) for active subscriptions |
| expansion_mrr | Expansion MRR | Month-over-month increase in MRR for existing customers |
| churned_mrr | Churned MRR | MRR lost from cancelled subscriptions |

### Testing Coverage
- Schema tests: 100%
- Data quality tests: 95%
- Business logic tests: 90%
```

**Your Task**:
1. Update model documentation
2. Refresh metric definitions
3. Document breaking changes
4. Update dependency graph
5. Review with team

- **Python**: Backfill scripts
- **Slack**: Stakeholder communication
- **Confluence**: Documentation

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Always test incremental logic** with both full refresh and incremental runs
2. **Document before deprecating** - give users time to migrate
3. **Profile queries** before optimizing - measure twice, cut once
4. **Version your metrics** - track changes over time
5. **Automate repetitive tasks** - focus on high-value work

Remember: As an Analytics Engineer, you're the guardian of data quality and the enabler of self-service analytics. Your work directly impacts every data consumer in the organization!
